        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            To receive our professional help all you need to do is submit a request to have your pool tested. This process consists of receiving a test kit in the mail where you follow the simple directions to find the balance in the ph and other chemical levels. Along with that we will just need a picture to evaluate as well! Once you have all that information you can submit the results electronically where we can give you an estimate of the chemicals needed to keep that pool nice. We will also pair you with a SparklePools expert who will guide you through keeping that pool nice and blue. Then you can purchase all needed equipment and chemicals from us. We also offer a monthly subscription where you can receive monthly estimates and receive all chemicals and tools needed.
